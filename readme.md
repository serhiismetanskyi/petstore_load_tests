# PetStore Load Tests

Hello to everyone who came here!

You are in the load tests repository for a simple Petstore API.

I used Python and Locust when writing load tests.

## Installation Steps:
* Clone this repo
* Navigate to project folder
* Open CLI
* Configure a virtual environment
* pip3 install -r requirements.txt
* locust --config=config.yml
